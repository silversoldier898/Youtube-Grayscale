Thanks for looking at this. This is a personal "project" of mine to help reduce the amount of time I spend on YouTube. Unless I think of any features or something breaks this is basically finished. Feel free to create any pull requests with features you want/want added but if it changes the nature of the plugin much I probably wont accept
