Thanks for looking at this. This is a personal "project" of mine to help reduce the amount of time I spend on YouTube. Unless I think of any features or something breaks this is basically finished. Feel free to create any pull requests with features you want/want added but if it changes the nature of the plugin much I probably wont accept

Free for all to use and edit under **MIT** license. Not really sure how to add that in at this point but that is the intent. If you are worried about me giving you the code like that just ask an AI model. I didn't even write this code AI did.
